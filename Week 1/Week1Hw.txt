Graphical User Interface allows users to manage a device's operating system, with both a keyboard and mouse, by using icons or pictures. An example would be the file explorer using an icon that looks similar to a folder we would use to store physical files in. Graphical User Interface is used in most modern computer systems as an easier way for the user to navigate and manage save files on the system. Command Line Interface is different than Graphical User Interface by the means of navigation. 
Command Line Interface allows the user to navigate the operating system, requiring only a keyboard, by using lines of coding in a command module. Command Line Interface is a more difficult way of accessing the operating systems files than Graphical User Interface, but offers a more precise and linear way of navigation. Additionally, when using Command User Interface, accessing the operating system can be much faster than it would take to use Graphical User Interface.
Most individuals prefer using Graphic User Interface as it allows the ability of the new user to recognize images to access the operating system. which is why software companies use this user interface to introduce new customers to their devices. Furthermore, the Graphical User Interface offers a simple way to learn how to manipulate and access the devices saved files and operating system.
