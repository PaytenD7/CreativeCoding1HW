Graphical User Interface allows users to manage a device's operating system by using icons or pictures. An example would be the file explorer using an icon that looks similar to a folder we would use to store physical files in. Graphical User Interface is used in most modern computer systems as an easier way for the user to navigate and manage save files on the system. Command Line Interface is different than Graphical User Interface by the means of navigation. Command Line Interface allows the user to navigate saved files by using lines of coding in a command module. Command Line Interface is a more difficult way of accessing the operating systems files than Graphical User Interface, but offers a more precise and linear way of navigation.
