Learning styles come in a variety of different ways. The most effective ways of studying depend entirely on ones preference. I, for one, am a visual learner, and I tends to lean more towards a visual way when studying. I thrive most when others can show me how to do certain tasks instead of telling me how to do said tasks. With this being said, I have an easier time learning when the demonstrations are more hands on and visual. 
Not everyone is like that though. My wife, for example, thrives most when she is able to do the tasks on her own. She learns best by trying out the tasks and then learns after the task is complete. She is able to remember most of the material thrown at her when she has the ability to try it to for herself.
With that being said, I like to use her form of learning when I am struggling to understand a certain concept. I tend to use a combination of both when learning because both the visual and tactile way of learning allows me to create a deeper understand through developing a connection  with the material. Using learning styles that aren't catered to ones preferred style actually can help the learning process, much like what I do when I am learning new material.
In the article, it claims that learning styles don't technically matter. This may be true, but to those who have found a way to effectively retain material shouldn't try and change their ways. Each individual is different but the methods they had offered (space out their study sessions, experience the material in multiple modalities, test themselves on the material, and elaborate on material to make meaningful connections) actually do help in ones ability to learn. I know this from personal experience that a combination of your learning style and the styles listed above can help you most effectively learn.
